# Deterministic Distributed Transactions atop a Partitioned, Replicated KV Store

`@author andrii dobroshynskyi`

## Intro

- Implementation of a version of system proposed in the [Calvin](http://cs.yale.edu/homes/thomson/publications/calvin-sigmod12.pdf) paper - a partitioned key-value store in Elixir, supporting asynchronous and Raft-based synchronous replication of transactional input, designed to run on arbitrary shared-nothing machines

- Deterministic storage system - transaction client requests are agreed upon by designated components of the system and guaranteed to be executed by all replicas and corresponding partitions within each replica

## Why Transactions and (Distributed) Txs?

- Multiple operations applied as an atomic unit, or none of them applied, storage system remains in consistent state

- When having multiple replicas that communicate via message passing, how do we ensure they stay in sync? What to do if a replica accepts a transaction but fails just before execution? What about in the middle of transaction execution?

## Why Deterministic storage systems?

- No fundamental reason why a transaction should abort amidst a nondeterministic event (machine failure or equivalent) - systems might do so from practical considerations

- If can agree on input to the system prior to beginning of execution, then on failure and subsequent recovery can
    - re-play input logged to disk __or__
    - recover from a fellow replica that is guaranteed to be executing the exact same transactional input

## What is the original Calvin paper about (simplified)?

- The original Calvin paper proposes a layer to run against a non-transactional storage system to transform it into “highly available” DB system supporting ACID transactions

- Splits time into epochs, transactions are batched

- Focuses on throughput, proposing to use a specific locking mechanism to ensure transactions execute in parallel (efficiently) but in agreed upon order against the storage layer

## Results & Some Experiments

- A working prototype of a replicated, partitioned key-value store based on the Calvin system

- Elixir Components for `Sequencer`, `Scheduler`, `Storage` that run as independent RSMs

- Every transaction computes its own write and read sets, data automatically partitioned according to the keys in the operations that determine these sets

- Replication mode specified as `:async` or `:raft`, every Sequencer maintains a Raft state that it uses to manage Raft-based replication

- Why need Raft? Async replication = very difficult failover when primary / main fails, want to use quorum for commit

- Transaction batches get forwarded to correct Schedulers at every epoch & interleaved

- Each storage node only contains the data that it needs to based on the partitioning scheme - system figures out which transaction updates are “local” and which are not and executes accordingly

- Supports launch of arbitrary number of replicas partitioned against an arbitrary number of nodes per replica

- Lots of Elixir tests to make sure expected & consistent state & more in code!

## Some remaining questions

- Empty batches need to be replicated by design leading to halts with network delays when delay >> epoch time - ways to optimize?

- Load balancing client requests?
